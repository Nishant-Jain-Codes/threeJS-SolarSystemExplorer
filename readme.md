**Explore the wonders of our solar system in 3D! Dive into a mesmerizing journey through the celestial bodies that orbit our sun. This project combines the power of 3D graphics with artificial intelligence to bring you an interactive and educational experience.**

## Motivation

**Why am I making this project?**

I am creating the Solar System Explorer project to master the technologies I've learned during the Code Along tutorial. This project represents a personal journey of exploration and skill development. It provides a hands-on opportunity to deepen my understanding of React, Three.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and other advanced technologies.

Through building an interactive 3D solar system, my goal is to solidify my proficiency in these cutting-edge tools and elevate my web development skills to a higher level. This project allows me to apply what I've learned in a practical context.

## Where I Learned This
